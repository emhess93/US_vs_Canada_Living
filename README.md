# Data Analysis Project

## Overview

The project is my capstone project for CODE:You. The project analyzes sales data to gain insights into various factors, including item sales throughout their life cycles, top development factors, and more. The goal of the project is to demonstrate a general knowledge of Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about sales, including details such as title, genre, publisher, developer, critic scores, total sales, and release dates.
- [Data 1](https://kaggle.com)
- [Data 2](https://kaggle.com)

### Project Structure
---

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data Exploration:** Jupyter notebooks or scripts to explore the dataset.

- **Analysis:** Using Python with the  Pandas package to clean the data.

- **Visualizations :** Using Matplotlib and Plotly to visualize my findings. 

- **Dashboard:** Additionally generat of the data dashboard. [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover/viz-of-the-day)

## Features Utilized for the project

  | Feature        | Description                           |
  |----------------|---------------------------------------|
  | Read TWO data files| Used 2 CSV files from kaggle          |
  | Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.      | Cleaned my data and merged them with pandas. The calculated stats from various data points |
  | Make 3 matplotlib, and Plotly | Made various plots to show off my findings. |
  | Make a Tableau dashboard      | Made a dashboard with my findings. [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover/viz-of-the-day) |
  | Utilize a virtual environment      | Made a venv for this project to keep my computer clean. |
  | Notate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook | Included in my code, you will find clear notes describing each code block. |
